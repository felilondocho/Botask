# Botask
Botask is a program that, using questions about atributes, could guess a 
Country that you are thinking.
It uses the DBpedia ontology.
To use this project, you must have the MySQL connector
for java (http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/)
and Apache Jena library(https://jena.apache.org/download/index.cgi).
Also you have to import the Database of the Continents to your MySQL.
